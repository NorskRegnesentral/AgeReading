Description: Stock assessments of different fish stocks are often based on age structured data from catch and scientific surveys. Age information is obtained from reading calcified structures,like scales or otoliths. Many sources of uncertainty are involved  in the estimation of survey indices and commercial catch composition.  In this work, we analyze the effect of errors in age readings, including discrepancies between readers. We perform a model-based approach where age reading errors are defined through a parametric model. More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
